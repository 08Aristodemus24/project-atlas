* I've realized that the typical 9-5 isn't just going to cut it, and companies won't give and don't give a single fuck about whether they lay you off or not for the benefit of their organization. And we've talked about how I predict that typical people will now start having a revolution in this age of AI and hwo they willleverage something that has always existed in the human experience, that of creativity and the ability to evoke emotions of a human in another. And I think as someone who has been into fitness for a while now about 8 to 9 years and counting, I think the demand for being healthy and aesthetic and funcitonallly strong is growing and will continue to grow and something AI can never replace given that personal trainers still are sought after solely for the interaction clients and consumers get as a part of their service. And I thought that I as a engineer who has heavy experience not only in data but also as a application and web apps engineer could leverage what I know to build a website and app geared for people wanting to to be healthier, aesthetic, and functionally strong. I believe I have the gift for it because people younger than me like have always sought after my advice on how to be fit, and I've always done so willingly even without charge. I enjoy teaching in general and seeing growth in the people I mentor. And so I am now currently in the midst of starting my own personal training business, as my own side hustle, aside from my 9-5. I believe multiple opportunities can stem from this like being able to grow my alrady existing youtube channel and filling with artisanal methods of creating foods that fuel functional strength regimens like fermented foods as a way of empowering people to do it on their own, and also to fill this channel and hopefully an instagram with educational information on how to do functional strength exercises. I do this because I think we've lost the way of this artisanal way of nourishing ourselves that our ancestors would have done anyways had they still existed. This is my vision, and I believe more and more people will come to love this way of tradition that has existed for centuries and maybe even dating back to the dawn of man himself. Di na rin kasi talaga ang isang source ng income, in this day and age, you need youtube, investment, your own personal business or side hustle.

* build about page, credentials proving you're a trainer but also your own testimony as someone having trained for 9 years and counting, contact page
* I need to buyild a mechanism where clients can book a call with me based on my available times, pwede calendly
* clients can book free online consultations 
* gusto ko brand ko ay centered around holistic whole food nutrition, aesthetics coupled with functional strength
* in consultations you must 
a. profile clients level of training experience and body composition
b. set their program based on their fitness goals, training exp, and body composition
c. incorporate strength, aesthetics, functional strength, nutritional regimens.
d. if cutting monitor weight for one week with intuitive eating, if the weight doesn't move take average of all days caloric intake in the week and that will be maintenance calories, use that maintenance calories to minus maybe 250kcal. Di pwede mababa masyado as this will mess up lower their metabolic rate (ability to burn calories) too quick, they will also lose muscle which is essential for metabolic rate. Muscle is everything
e. if bulking ganun lang rin ulit, monitor kcal intake, determine maintenance kcal, and then add 250kcal coupled with training that goes in cycles of progressive overload.
f. pag skinny bagay sila magbulk, again liquid calories, whole food sources of fat e.g. eggs, butter, salmon, avocado, olive oil, coconut oil, not seed oils are perfect if they want to gain muscle without much fat
g. pag skinny fat bagay sa kanila mag recomposition aka cutting kcal while keeping protein intake and carbs still high with moderate fat
h. pag fat bagay sila mag cut like the guys that can do a recomposition phase
i. kung vegan sila medyo mahirap  kasi their sources of macros are scarce, if carnivore ganun rin, kaya its better to be in the middle so you can get varied sources of protein, fats, and carbs, from both animal and plant based sources.
* be there for your clients katulad ng kaibigan mo, give the information they need and let them decide & motivate them
* at the end of all these dapat di sila stressed masyado and they need to get whole foods with adequate nutrients
* instagram page will contain the ff. (doesn't have to be perfect like filled with research citations and biomechanical foundations from important people)
a. fermented foods preparation with ingredients in caption with end product at the end of photos
b. functional exercises and key mechanics to focus on e.g. zercher squats 200 x 4 x 6, keep spine neutral, engage core, keep tension on quads when exploding up, don't try to lift hips first to compensate for fatigued quads (this puts tension on the lower back rather than the quads), don't let knees cave in when exploding up, quads must be parallel to the ground but better if hamstring  touches calves as going up will cue your quads and calves to work together to explode up rather than compensating using hips
