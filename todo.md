* build about page, credentials proving you're a trainer but also your own testimony as someone having trained for 9 years and counting, contact page
* I need to buyild a mechanism where clients can book a call with me based on my available times, pwede calendly
* clients can book free online consultations 
* gusto ko brand ko ay centered around holistic whole food nutrition, aesthetics coupled with functional strength
* in consultations you must 
a. profile clients level of training experience and body composition
b. set their program based on their fitness goals, training exp, and body composition
c. incorporate strength, aesthetics, functional strength, nutritional regimens.
d. if cutting monitor weight for one week with intuitive eating, if the weight doesn't move take average of all days caloric intake in the week and that will be maintenance calories, use that maintenance calories to minus maybe 250kcal. Di pwede mababa masyado as this will mess up lower their metabolic rate (ability to burn calories) too quick, they will also lose muscle which is essential for metabolic rate. Muscle is everything
e. if bulking ganun lang rin ulit, monitor kcal intake, determine maintenance kcal, and then add 250kcal coupled with training that goes in cycles of progressive overload.
f. pag skinny bagay sila magbulk, again liquid calories, whole food sources of fat e.g. eggs, butter, salmon, avocado, olive oil, coconut oil, not seed oils are perfect if they want to gain muscle without much fat
g. pag skinny fat bagay sa kanila mag recomposition aka cutting kcal while keeping protein intake and carbs still high with moderate fat
h. pag fat bagay sila mag cut like the guys that can do a recomposition phase
i. kung vegan sila medyo mahirap  kasi their sources of macros are scarce, if carnivore ganun rin, kaya its better to be in the middle so you can get varied sources of protein, fats, and carbs, from both animal and plant based sources.
* be there for your clients katulad ng kaibigan mo, give the information they need and let them decide & motivate them
* at the end of all these dapat di sila stressed masyado and they need to get whole foods with adequate nutrients
